    "# Retrieval Evaluation for Semantic Search\n",

    "In this notebook, we evaluate the effectiveness of our semantic search engine using a small, manually curated test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Goals:\n",
    "1. Define (query, expected clause type) test cases.\n",
    "2. Use our semantic search engine to retrieve the top-K most relevant clauses.\n",
    "3. Evaluate the search quality using:\n",
    "   - **Precision@5**: Proportion of top-5 results that match the expected clause type.\n",
    "   - **Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)**: Measures the rank of the first correct result.\n",
    "4. Optionally, display returned clause types to debug relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This evaluation simulates how well the system performs in real-world legal retrieval scenarios.\n"
